- Create registration page where user can create accounts on a website
- Usually front-end forms are provided

How will user logic relate to app?
- Have own routes, forms, etc
- Should be separate from blog
- Logically, should create a new app in project
- use terminal command "python manage.py startapp users"

When you first create a blog app, better add it to installed apps list to save headache & debugging
